# Demo

This is a demo project intended to display implementation examples of Elasto.js.
Download the source package or visit the
[sandbox demo site](https://godiagonal.github.io/elasto-js/demo) to try it out.

Note: When using Elasto.js it's a good idea to override elasto.css styles in a custom
css file to avoid loss of data when updating to a new version of the library. See
[elasto-custom.css](css/elasto-custom.css) for an example on how to do this.
