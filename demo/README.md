# Demo

This is a demo project intended to display implementation examples of Elasto.js.
Download the source package or visit `https://godiagonal.github.com/elasto-js`
to try the demo.

Note: It's a good idea to override elasto.css styles in a custom css file to
avoid loss of data when updating to a new version of the library. See
`demo/css/elasto-custom.css` for an example on how to do this.
