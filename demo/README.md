# Demo

This is a demo project intended to display implementation examples of Elasto.js.
Download the source package or visit the
[demo site](https://godiagonal.github.com/elasto-js) to try it out.

Note: It's a good idea to override elasto.css styles in a custom css file to
avoid loss of data when updating to a new version of the library. See
[elasto-custom.css](demo/css/elasto-custom.css) for an example on how to do this.
